## Fix all bugs with SIM2 and release as SIM2.1
    - Run program only executes the first word of memory on first run for some reason
    - maybe add actuall gui with like a fake front pannel, switches and lights:
        - maybe look like an altair8800 or a pdp11/70 front pannel (except 4 bit of course)
    - implement halt command that only works when running, but stops execution
    - rewrite in C
    - make an 8 bit version
